- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Yi Sun, but you can call me Tim.
- ðŸŒ„ When I'm not glued to my computer, you'll find me out in the wild, exploring new trails, or hitting the off-road with my trusty vehicle. I'm also a huge fan of all kinds of ball sports, whether it's soccer, basketball, or even a game of table tennis.
- ðŸŒ± Lifelong learner alert! I'm constantly on the lookout for new opportunities to expand my knowledge in various fields. Got any recommendations?.
- ðŸ’¡ I'm all about exciting collaborations! If you've got an interesting project or initiative in mind, count me in. Let's brainstorm and make things happen!
- ðŸ“« Feel like chatting? Shoot me an email at jerrmayi@hotmail.com. Whether it's a friendly hello or a potential opportunity, I'm all ears and ready to connect. Let's make some magic together! ðŸš€
